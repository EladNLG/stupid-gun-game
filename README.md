stupid gun game but stupider <br />

cool features that aren't present in fvnk's version: <br />
Dinotick's houseflies mod on last weapon <br />
cool admin command to toggle houseflies for a certain person or for everyone (hs name/all 0/1) <br />
2 additional weapons (arc wave and thermal shield)
The order of guns is random, but the same for every player
melee will reset you one point, if you are not at the puls blade
